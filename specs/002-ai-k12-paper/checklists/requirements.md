# Specification Quality Checklist: AI in K-12 Classrooms Research Paper

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified (Implicit in the "Out of Scope" items)
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified (Implicit in the detailed prompt)

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The user prompt was extremely detailed and well-structured, allowing for a comprehensive and high-quality specification with no clarifications needed. The spec is ready for `/sp.plan`.
