## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Understand AI's Impact on Efficiency (Priority: P1)

As an education administrator, I want to read a research paper that clearly explains how AI applications can reduce teacher workload and improve student outcomes, so I can make informed, evidence-backed decisions about technology adoption in my district.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition for the target audience, addressing their primary concerns of efficiency and effectiveness.

**Independent Test**: An administrator can articulate 3+ specific, evidence-backed examples of AI applications and their impact on the classroom after reading the paper.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** an administrator has read the paper, **When** asked about AI for teacher automation, **Then** they can describe a specific tool and its proven effect on reducing administrative tasks.
2.  **Given** an administrator has read the paper, **When** asked about personalized learning, **Then** they can explain how an AI-driven platform can improve student outcomes, referencing data from the paper.
