# Research: AI in K-12 Classrooms

**Status**: Completed

This document outlines the research plan for the "AI in K-12 Classrooms" paper.

## 1. Research Questions

The primary research will focus on answering the following:
1.  What are the most effective, evidence-backed AI applications currently used in K-12 classrooms for reducing teacher workload?
2.  What are the most effective, evidence-backed AI applications for improving student outcomes?
3.  What quantitative data is available to support an ROI analysis for these applications? (e.g., hours saved, test score improvements).
4.  What are the key findings and recommendations from recent (last 5 years) peer-reviewed literature on this topic?

## 2. Source Identification

**Decision**: Research will prioritize academic databases like JSTOR, Google Scholar, and the ACM Digital Library to find at least 8 high-quality, peer-reviewed sources.

**Rationale**: The specification requires evidence-backed claims and peer-reviewed sources. Academic databases are the most reliable way to find this type of literature.

**Alternatives considered**:
*   Relying on news articles and blog posts: Rejected as they often lack the rigor required for a research paper and may not be evidence-based.

## 3. Citation Management

**Decision**: A citation management tool like Zotero or Mendeley will be used to collect sources and automatically generate APA-formatted citations and a bibliography. The bibliography will be exported to a `.bib` file.

**Rationale**: This automates the tedious and error-prone process of citation formatting, ensuring compliance with the APA requirement.

## 4. ROI Framework

**Decision**: The research will identify a simple, clear framework for calculating ROI that is suitable for education administrators. The framework will likely be based on: `(Value Gained - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment`.
-   **Value Gained**: Monetized value of saved teacher hours + monetized value of improved student outcomes.
-   **Cost of Investment**: Software licensing, training, and support costs.

**Rationale**: A simple, standardized framework is necessary to make the ROI analysis clear and understandable for the non-technical target audience.
